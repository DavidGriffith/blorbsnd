This repository contains a series of exercises in audio programming.

The files playaiff series of programs load and play AIFF files.  After 
the first one, later programs in this series will also load and play WAV 
and OGG files.  This is because those programs use libsndfile to load 
the file and parse its header information.  The first program does the 
parsing directly.

The playmod series loads and plays MOD files.

The blorbsnd series of programs is intended to put together what is 
learned in the other two series to play AIFF, MOD, or OGG files embedded 
in a Blorb file.  A Blorb file is an IFF type that is used to wrap up 
audio and graphics data along with a game file for play on an 
interactive fiction interpreter.  Several interpreters already support 
this, but Unix Frotz (https://github.com/DavidGriffith/frotz) does not.  
Getting Unix Frotz to do this is the overall reason for these exercises.
